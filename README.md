Vim Hero
========

Vim Hero is my customized Vim that I mainly use for web development and Python coding.
If you want to try it just run the setup.sh file after cloning the repo.

Vim Hero conatains several must have plugins for Vim:
* Nerd Commenter:

    For easily commenting multiple lines.

* Vim Surround:

    For surrounding any selected phrase or word with tags or quotation marks.

* Vim Easy Motion:

    For easily jumping to a specific word in the viewport.

* Sparkup:

    An amazingly fast way to write HTML.

    Ex: ul > li.item-$**3 > strong

  Then you press CTRL + e and the code above expands as:

  <ul>
    <li class="item-1"><strong></strong></li>
    <li class="item-2"><strong></strong></li>
    <li class="item-3"><strong></strong></li>
  </ul>

* Snipmate:

    For using predefined snippets while coding.
    Ex: for<TAB> instantly creates a for loop which can after be edited easily. 

* Nerd Tree:
    For browsing files. You can toggle it with F10 key.

* Tag Bar:
    For listing and jumping to the members of the module; variables, classes, methods.
    Use CTRL + T to toggle.

* Vim Powerline
    A super cool and informative status bar for Vim.

* Syntastic:
  On the fly syntax checking. Very helpful while coding. Instantly shows errors on the screen.

* Vim Autoclose:
  For auto closing quotation marks.
